#   Translation Notes: It is quite simple to translate Steem into 
# a different language, here's how. 
#
#   The first thing to do is copy this file into the same directory
# as your Steem.exe and call it Translate_ followed by the name of
# the language you are translating it into, followed by .txt. For 
# example if you were doing a French translation you would call it
# Translate_Francais.txt. Steem will now automatically use this
# file for its translations.
#
#   The text to be translated comes in blocks of two lines - Steem 
# looks for the first line and will then display the second line on
# the screen.  Therefore, you must leave the first line alone and 
# only change the second line into your own language.
#
#   Some points to watch out for: You must edit and save the file
# as PLAIN TEXT, the best program to use is Notepad.  If you use a
# different editor, make sure it does not add extra line-returns in
# the middle of lines when word-wrapping.  Also, you must not take
# away the spacing between lines.
#
#   Try not to make your translations much longer than the original
# English text.  Steem does not allow much spare room for the text
# to appear.  Remember, other users may use a larger default font
# size on their display than you do, so don't try to squeeze it in.
#
#   You will see the & character in some pieces of text here,
# immediately before a letter.  This is used by Windows to signify
# a shortcut key.  You may move the & to any character in your
# translation, or leave it out entirely.  Try not to add extra
# &'s in your translations, they may not appear properly.
#
#   There is a special translation that will appear in the
# general info dialog to tell everyone the name of the person
# they have to thank for being able to use Steem in their own 
# language. Simply replace "[Your Name]" in "Translation by 
# [Your Name]" with whatever you call yourself. If you don't
# want anything to appear just make the translation "   " (spaces).
#
#   There is another special translation for Steem's patch system.
# "Patch Text Section=" can be changed to specify which section
# of a patch file the text will be retrieved from. For instance, for
# a German translation change it to "DeutschText" and then go
# through every patch file adding something like this below the
# [Text] section and before the [Patch] section:
#
# [DeutschText]
# Description=This is a patch
# ApplyWhen=Something happens
# Version=Works on Steem v..    (we'll keep this up to date)
# PatchAuthor=Translated by [Your Name]
#
# Of course, it will be more useful if the text to the right of the
# ='s is German. :) The names of the text (i.e "Description", 
# "ApplyWhen") must not be translated (they don't appear on 
# screen). Once you have done that send us the patch files and 
# we'll release them when we can. Any patches that have a section 
# called "Obsolete=n" with "n" being 2.5 or lower do not need to 
# be translated. Since Steem v2.6 icon scheme files also use this 
# same system, so they can now be translated too.
# 
# Abbreviations used (translate them to something short!)
#   But    = (joystick) button
#   V.Fast = very fast
#   V.Slow = very slow
#   Min    = minimum
#   Max    = maximum
#   Del    = delete
#   OSD    = on screen display
#   Ret    = return key
#   Bksp   = backspace key
#
# In the CRASH AND BURN - ST RESET translation there can't be any 
# accents or special characters, if you can't translate it without them 
# then just leave it as English,  it shouldn't appear too often (hopefully).
#
# Good luck, I hope you find translating an almost painless process.
# When you have finished, send the file to steem@gmx.net
# so we can put a link to it near where Steem is downloaded. 
# Also take a look at the "multilingual" page of the Steem website 
# if you want to create a webpage which explains how to download 
# Steem in your language.

The most important file Steem needs to run is an image of the ST operating system TOS. If you haven't got one you cannot run Steem. They are easily downloadable from the internet, probably from the same place that you downloaded Steem. Alternatively you can get ST programs that will save out the TOS from an ST. After clicking OK find a TOS image file and click open. This setting, and all the other settings you are about to set, can be easily changed at any time when running Steem.

The next few settings regard the way Steem emulates disks. Steem, and all other ST emulators, use files with the extension ST, STT, DIM or MSA on a PC drive for its floppy disks. This is the format most things you download for the ST will be in. If you have some of these files already then you can tell Steem which folder they are in. This will become your home folder and makes it easy to switch disks in and out of drives. If you don't have any then select a suitable folder on your PC hard disk and Steem will create a blank disk for you there.
